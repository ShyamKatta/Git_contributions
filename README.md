# Git_contributions
The below file give the git contributions of a user given a valid access_token and username

Need to replace the access_token in line 228 of main function and username wherever applciable

The go function can replace file - https://github.com/ShyamKatta/Aporeto_challenge/blob/master/scripts/MyContributions_public.py and making necessary changes to nodejs script can result in same output.

The change was conversion of python code to similar code in Golang, but instead of JSON api calls and parsing them, used go-github library
